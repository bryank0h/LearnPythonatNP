# ID Assignment 2:<br>Learn Python at Ngee Ann Polytechnic
**Team Members: Bryan Koh, Nicholas Lee**

For this assignment, we will be working on a website which educates and teaches students in Ngee Ann Polytechnic about the fundamentals/basics of Python. Our goal is set out to enhance and gamify the experience of learning the Python language, while being able to hone their skills via our web application. Our target audience would be to benefit students of Information Technology, or any related courses that will make use of the language.

Students would be able to use their email to log in to our website. Students get to use two modes: Tutorial Mode and Speed Training Mode. There is also a Quick Revise page which allows student to learn quickly via a one-page documentary. <br>
In Tutorial Mode, students get to learn the different basic topics at their own pace, and each topic comes with an easy coding question, and can proceed to the next topic when they get the question correct. <br>
In Speed Training Mode, it is assumed that Students have already aquired the basic knowledge and this is the mode to challenge themselves. They have an option of two difficulties, easy and standard. Easy mode will be in the form of MCQ questions, while standard mode will be in the form of short coding questions. The students' task will be to answer a set of 15 randomized questions correctly under a set time. They have three lives. The challenge will immediately end if three lives are up.

A certificate will be presented upon completion of Tutorial Mode or Speed Training Mode.
